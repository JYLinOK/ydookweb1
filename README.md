## Note:
1. This vue front end program is made in vue-cli;
2. Beacuse the size of auto-genrated node_modules is over the maximum of the upload file standard, so the folder of "node_modules" need to make by youself by "Node.JS";
3. You can download the file directly to use, but please note that you need to entablish the folder of "node_modules";
4. In third item, you can use the Node.JS to make a avaible addictional folder of "node_modules"ï¼›
5. After edit, you can use the packing command code of Node.JS in shell or terminal to entablish a final running project pack of Vue.JS.
